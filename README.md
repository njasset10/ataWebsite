##Recommended Formatting

### JSX Formatting
* React components are bootstrapped starting in js/index.  
* All JSX templates use JSX Harmony (ES6) styling.  
* Refer to Hello.jsx for examples.  

### Less Formatting
* Less styles are bootstrapped through less/main.less and included in index.jsx.  
* somefile.jsx which implement a component should also have a somefile.less for it's corresponding styles.  
* somefile.jsx and somefile.less should reside together in their own folder (somefile).
